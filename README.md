# DeepReduce

A Sparse-tensor Communication Primitive for Distributed Deep Learning

**Abstrat**: Sparse tensors appear frequently in distributed deep learning, either as a direct artifact of the deep neural networkâ€™s gradients, or as a result of an explicit sparsification process, which is commonly employed to alleviate the communication bottleneck. Existing communication primitives are agnostic to the peculiarities of deep learning; consequently, they impose unnecessary communication load. This paper introduces DeepReduce, a versatile primitive for the compressed communication of sparse tensors, tailored for distributed deep learning. DeepReduce decomposes sparse tensors in two sets, values and indices, and allows both independent and combined compression of these sets. We support a variety of common compressors, such as gzip for values or run-length encoding for indices. We also propose two novel compression schemes that achieve superior results: curve fitting-based for values and bloom filter-based for indices. DeepReduce is orthogonal to existing gradient sparsification methods and can be applied in conjunction with them, transparently to the end user, to significantly lower the communication overhead. As proof of concept, we implement our approach on Tensorflow. Our experiments with large real models demonstrate that DeepReduce transmits around 50% fewer data than existing methods, without affecting the training accuracy.

## Prerequisites

The code is built with following libraries:

- Python >= 3.7
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) >= 1.4
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) >= 1.14
- [GRACE](https://github.com/sands-lab/grace) >=1.0

## Benchmarks

We use the following benchmarks to run our experiments:

- [Image Classification/tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/sands-lab/grace-benchmarks/tree/master/tensorflow/Classification/tf_cnn_benchmarks) [TensorFlow] ResNet-20, ResNet-50
- [Image_Classification/Cifar10](https://github.com/sands-lab/grace-benchmarks/tree/master/torch/cifar10) [PyTorch] ResNet-20
- [Recommendation/NCF](https://github.com/sands-lab/grace-benchmarks/tree/master/torch/Recommendation/NCF) [PyTorch] NCF

## Usage

For the usage of GRACE and environment setup etc., please check the guides [here](https://github.com/sands-lab/grace).

First, create a GRACE instance from `params`. `params` should include parameters for both GRACE and DeepReduce. The valid parameter options for DeepReduce is listed as below:

```python
'''
'deepreduce': None, 'value', 'index', 'both'
'value': None, 'polyfit', ...(other custom methods)
'index': None, 'bloom', ...(other custom methods)
'''
from grace_dl.dist.helper import grace_from_params
params = {'compressor': 'topk', 'memory': 'residual', 'communicator': 'allgather', 'compress_ratio': 0.01, 'deepreduce':'index', 'index':'bloom'}
grc = grace_from_params(params)
```

Once you get a desired GRACE instance, warp the compressor by DeepReduce. After that, you can use DeepReduce in the same way as GRACE.

```python
deepreduce_wrapper = {'value': ValueCompressor,
                      'index': IndexCompressor,
                      'both': DeepReduce}
DReduce = deepreduce_wrapper[deepreduce](grc.compressor, params)
grc.compressor = DReduce
```

## Scripts & Data

We provide the bash scripts to reproduce the experiments in our paper. All experiment results are also available at [WANDB](https://wandb.ai/sands-lab/deepreduce/reports/DeepReduce--VmlldzoxODM5NTU) database.
